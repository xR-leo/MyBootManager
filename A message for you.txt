Hello dear users, I will introduce you to "Easy entry into Safe mode". 
in truth, I will tell you this is my first job, yes, I used AI, well, there were problems, it helped me, 
and so I released it and easy entry into Safe mode so that those who do not understand it, it simply contains .bat files and nothing else. 
I will try to improve it, maybe the new versions will already contain more than that.bat and .exe 
so that you can just click on what you want and it worked right away, and there was a kind of language so that everyone 
could understand what each function does. 
I would appreciate it if you could help me with this.
